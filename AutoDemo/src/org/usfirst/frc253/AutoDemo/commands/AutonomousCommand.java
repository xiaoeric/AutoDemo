    	//Available commands:
    	//DriveBackward(): drives the robot backward
    	//DriveForward(): drives the robot forward
    	//FlipFlipper(): flips the flipper
    	//RetractFlipper(): retracts the flipper
    	//RotateLeft(): robot rotates to the left; only robot orientation changes
    	//RotateRight(): robot rotates to the right; only robot orientation changes
    	//Spin120Clockwise(): robot spins 120 degrees clockwise; only robot orientation changes
    	//Spin120Counterwise(): robot spins 120 degrees counterclockwise; only robot orientation changes
    	//Spin90Clockwise(): robot spins 90 degrees clockwise; only robot orientation changes
    	//Spin90Counterwise(): robot spins 90 degrees counterclockwise; only robot orientation changes
    	//TurnLeft(): robot turns to the left; both robot orientation and position change
    	//TurnRight(): robot turns to the right; both robot orientation and position change
    	
    	//Timed commands:
    	//DriveForward(), DriveBackward(), RotateLeft(), RotateRight(), TurnLeft(), TurnRight()
    	//These commands must be provided with an amount of time to run (in seconds).
    	//e.g. addSequential(new DriveForward(1.0));
    	//This command drives the robot forward for 1.0 seconds.
